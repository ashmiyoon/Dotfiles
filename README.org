#+title: README for Brandon Yoon's Dotfiles repo

* Explanation
I often have to work on different systems, and it's extremely annoying having to set up my configuration every single time. So I created this config file to sync dotfiles between different systems. This repo includes basically every dotfile I use on my Arch Linux setup, from my .vimrc to my BSPWM configuration.

* Technical Details
This thing basically only works on non-*nix systems. But you probably already knew that lol.
My .vimrc file (for standard Vim) is different from my init.vim file (for NVim).
Certain more resource-intensive folders like `~/.config/discord` are excluded, since they aren't really important and are automatically generated by normal computer usage anyways.
** Programs to install before using
Most of the programs you will need to install are pretty obvious, like BSPWM and SXHKD. Here are some less obvious ones:
- vim-plug (I also excluded the `vimplugs` folder by default, since it just takes up space)
- Doom Emacs (I didn't include my .emacs.d folder because the repository structure is incredibly confusing. However, everything you need to replicate my setup should be in the `~/doom.d` anyway)
